# Instagram_solved

UPDATE
Instagram has finally changed a major redesign for desktop sites, so this solution has been implemented by instagram, except for the fact that the targetted advertisement is still what differentiates, so if you want to use a ads free experience you can use the project. Thanks for supporting this intiative

note -

* abide the rules of instagram while using the tool
* In 2021, every user can like up to 1,000 posts per day, but some accounts might be banned after 800 likes. It is generally better for new Instagram accounts to keep their accounts safe with 10 likes per hour
